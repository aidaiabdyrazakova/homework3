            Japan is the eleventh most populous country in the world, as well as
            one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths
            of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its
            population of 125.5 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is
            divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional
            regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan
            area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.
